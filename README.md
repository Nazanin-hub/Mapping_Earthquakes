# Mapping_Earthquakes
creating interactive maps using Leaflet.js, GeoJSON , Javascript and D3 library to retrieve earthquakes data

## Project Overview

Building insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes in the past 7 days from around the world. I retrieved the earthquake data using JavaScript, D3, and Leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. The magnitude and location of each earthquake have been shown in a popup marker. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes have been displayed larger and darker in color with a legend providing the context for the map. Then, I added the fault lines on the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates. Finally, I added the tectonic plate data as a second layer group and the major earthquake data as a third layer group.
